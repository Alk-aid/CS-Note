# 1. Syntax Denition

## 1.1 Definition of Grammers

A token consists of two components, a token name and an attribute value.

The token name are used by the parser for syntax analysis, which we call these token names `terminals`

The attribute value  is a pointer to the symbol table 

> In our discussion of syntax analysis, often we refer to tokens and terminals synonymously
