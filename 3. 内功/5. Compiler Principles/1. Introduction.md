# 1. Language Processors

- `Compiler`: 
  - a program that can translate a program in one language into another language
  - an important role of the compiler is to report any error during the translation process
- `Interpreter`:
  - directly execute the operations specified in the source program
- `Comparison`
  - `Compiler` faster than `interpreter` at mapping inputs to outputs
  - `Intepreter` give better error diagnostics than a compiler
- create an excutable target progam (Compiler Pattern)
  - Using `preprocessor` to collect the source program which be divided into modules stores int separate fileã€‚`preproccessor` may also expand macros into source language statements
  - Using `Compiler` to produce an assembly - language proagram as its output
  - Using `Assembler` to produces relocatable machine code
  - Using `Linker` to link relocatable object file and libray files thus produce a code that actually runs on the machine.

.c -> (preprocessor) -> .i  -> (compile) -> .s -> (assembly) -> .o  -> (link)  -> .out
